# mirror
A Java representation of jQuery, using Reflection to interact with things.

jQuery is used to interact with the DOM in JavaScript. Java doesn't have a DOM, so the next best thing was Reflection, which interacts with everything in Java.

I recently found out `$` could be used as an identifier in Java, and I immediately thought of jQuery. jQuery messes with the DOM, Relfection messes with Classes. Put two and two together and we've got mirror!
